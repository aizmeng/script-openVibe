Various scripts to sort out data.

First try for R statistics.

* Eduflow2_stats.csv and swedish_stats.csv: Questionnaires data retrieved from the online formulaires, converted to CSV 

* automate_ov.py: python script that will automate the execution of OpenViBE over previously recorded data in order to extract relevent information reguarding subjects' performances. Outputs data.npz (formatted for python numpy library).

* npz2csv.py: convert automate_ov.py output from npz to a csv file (data.csv)

* flow.R: trying to find a correlation between perf and flow
